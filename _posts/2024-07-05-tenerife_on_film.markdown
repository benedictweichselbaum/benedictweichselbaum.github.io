### A vacation on film
Because I left my now former employer at the end of June and I had 80h of overtime still in my time account I was able to take a vacation at the end of the month with three of my friends. So we booked flights and took off to Tenerife in the Canaries. Why Tenerife? The Spanish island has year round perfect weather, great scenery and amazing food. What more do you want.

Before Tenerife I never shot a trip on film. To make the most of it, I took with me three cameras and shot 7 rolls of film with 36 exposures each. More details on the equipment later. For the processing I used the development expertise of "Foto Seitz" in Nuremberg, a local photo shop near me. The digitalization of the negatives was done by myself.

### Technical details
Before I talk about the pictures I want to show you my technical setup. First my used cameras:

| Camera | Lenes |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| Minolta XD7 | Minolta 50mm f/1.4, Minolta 24-35mm f/3.5, Minolta 70-210mm f/4 |
| Minolta SRT 100X | Minolta 50mm f/1.4, Minolta 24-35mm f/3.5, Minolta 70-210mm f/4 |
| Fujica STX-1 | Fujinon 55mm f/2.2, Porst 28mm f/2.8 |

For the digitalization I used my Sony Î±68 with the Sigma 105mm f/2.8 macro lens. For the inverting of the negatives I used the paid software "FilmLab".

### Lomography Fantome 8 (Minolta SRT 100X)

The first film I want to present is the extrem low speed (ISO 8) Fantome 8 black and white film by Lomography. The film proved to be very difficult to shoot. Not because of the low speed but because the photos require extreme contrast to create an interesting look. A well lit scenery that has not a lot of contrast creates a flat uninteresting image. But if you find the right composition the film creates  interesting looks with inky blacks.
